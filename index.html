    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1> 
    <h2>Some stuff about me</h2>  
    <p style="text-indent:2em">
        Hello, my name is Zechariah Gonzales. My current major is Computer Programming Technology, I had a different one before, 
        but it wasn’t what I wanted to do in the long run, so I made the smart decision to switch. 
        I currently serve in the United States Air Force working in Supply. 
        I am originally from California, but I currently live in North Carolina. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:2em">
        When I’m not at work, my fiancée and I like to go on walks down by the river or just hang out at home watching different TV shows.
        I also like to play video games. I mainly play PC games, but I just bought an Oculus Quest 2 so I've been enjoying the VR games.
        I accidently got too close to a wall in my house and I ended up puching it by accident. It hurt pretty bad. 
        I’ve never worked with HTML before so this class will be very informative.

    <h2>Websites I like to spend time on</h2>
    <ol>
       <li> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>: there are a lot of different subreddits so its easy to get lost and spend way too 
           much time here.</li>
       <li> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>: I have a few different streaming subscriptions but I probably use Netflix the most.</li>
       <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>: the 2 day prime shipping is addictive and keeps draining my bank account. 
           I need help with this website.</li>
    </ol>
