        Hello, my name is Zechariah Gonzales. My current major is Computer Programming Technology, I had a different one before, 
        but it wasn’t what I wanted to do in the long run, so I made the smart decision to switch. 
        I currently serve in the United States Air Force working in Supply. 
        I am originally from California, but I currently live in North Carolina.

        When I’m not at work, my fiancée and I like to go on walks down by the river or just hang out at home watching different TV shows.
        I also like to play video games. I mainly play PC games, but I just bought an Oculus Quest 2 so I've been enjoying the VR games.
        I accidently got too close to a wall in my house and I ended up puching it by accident. It hurt pretty bad. 
        I’ve never worked with HTML before so this class will be very informative.
