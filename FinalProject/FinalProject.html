	<h1> Hello there! </h1>

	<p> If you are here it is because you are just starting out in Black Desert Online
	 or you are looking into the game to see if it is a game you should try out. 
	Our goal here is to break down the very basics of the game that will not 
	only help your journey in the long run but also help you avoid early obstacles 
	that newer players tend to get stuck on. </p>

	<h1> What is Black Desert Online? </h1>

	<p> Black Desert is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. It has a 
	medieval fantasy setting with an open world to explore. The game has an action style
	combat system where different key combinations will execute different skills for 
	each class in the game. The graphical quality of the game was quite high even at 
	launch but was upgraded even further in their remastered version. While the 
	game can have extremely high graphic modes it also has a low optimization mode 
	if you either don’t care about visuals or you don’t have a powerful enough computer.</p> 
 
	<h1> What do you do? </h1>

	<p> While many of the endgame players are focused on the weekly wars to control the 
	different Nodes and Territories within the world, a new player should focus on 
	leveling up and going through the main storyline. There is no true level cap in the 
	game, there are soft caps in the game where the experience needed is so high that it
	takes a ridiculously long time to gain even 1% of the needed experience. Gear is 
	also a long-term goal within the game which I will link guides to later. 
	At the end of the day whatever you find enjoyable or exciting about the game is what
	you should be doing. </p>
