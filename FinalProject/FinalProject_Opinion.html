	<h1> My Own Experience </h1>
	<p> I’ve played this game off and on since it first launched. I would be lying if I said that it was all 
	sunshine and roses since the beginning, but it has been an interesting journey none the less. When BDO first 
	came out I had a lot more free time on my hands than I do now which I spent a lot it playing this game. The game is very
 	addicting at first, leveling up is quick and feels rewarding and you are getting rewards left and right. It can be a bit too 
	much for a new player but it doesn’t take long to catch up on the different mechanics of the game. The biggest thing that drives most
 	people away from the game is the fact that it is not a quick game, it’s a marathon. After the initial hype of 
	leveling and getting better gear, things begin to take longer and longer to achieve. It gets to the point where 
	you can go months without any improvement to your gear, and while the current state of the game is very different from 
	launch it still can feel daunting when you are planning out what you want to do and achieve. If you do decide to play I would 
	highly encourage you to set clear defined goals that you want to reach, because if you don’t you can start to feel 
	like a chicken with its head cut off. Overall, I think the game is quite fun even if you do just long in for 
	30 minutes a day to kick some monster butt and then long off.
